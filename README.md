# JIRA_API
This is a Google Apps Script used to import issues from JIRA into Google Sheets. 
This script was originally written by 
[Iain Brown](http://www.littlebluemonkey.com/blog/automatically-import-jira-backlog-into-google-spreadsheet) in 2014, and modified by [Owen Phillips](https://github.com/ophilli/) while interning at [Model N, Inc.](http://www.modeln.com) in 2016. It was inspired by [Gmail Snooze with Apps Script](http://gmailblog.blogspot.co.nz/2011/07/gmail-snooze-with-apps-script.html).

________

It can be configured to poll any JIRA instance, and request any kind of issue from any number of project boards.
